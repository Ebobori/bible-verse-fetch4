              "The twelve gates are twelve pearls  - each gate made of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, clear as crystal.",
              "I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb.",
              "The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.",
              "The people will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their wealth into it.",
